# Core elements of a German psychiatric patient record in FHIR
Is it possible to identify and integrate core elements of a psychiatric patient record, and can they be fully coded in an internationally standardized way, stored in the central IT infrastructure of a clinic (in Germany) independently of the manufacturer and automatically contextualized for evaluation? 

The aim of standardization in FHIR® is interoperable data processing of health information. This includes biological measurement data, but more frequently the collection of health information using questionnaires.

The data that is relevant for processing the research question is compiled here.

# Project Overview
This project outlines the FHIR specification of the German
Psychiatric Data Set (GPDS). The FHIR instances, profiles, and implementation guides developed in this context serve as a specification for the syntactic and semantic interoperabilty of psychiatric instruments in Germany.

# Status
Current Stable Version: 1.0.0

All FHIR artifacts published within this project are assigned a status that indicates their maturity level. Profiles marked as 'Draft' have not yet been balloted and are subject to significant changes.
